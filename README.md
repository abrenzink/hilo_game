# Hilo
Are you willing to risk everything? Play Hilo and you might be surprised. The rules are simple. A 
carrd with a value will be drawn. Make a bet if the next drawn card will have a higher or lower value.
If your guess is right, you sum 100 point. If not, you lose 75 points. Keep playing util you reach a score
lower than 0.

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and
